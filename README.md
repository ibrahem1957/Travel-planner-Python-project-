# Travel planner Python project
This project is a simple travel planner assistant built in Python.
It was created as one of the requirements of the AI model building and development bootcamp offered by Tuwaiq Academy.

### Why use our travel planner?

We chose this idea because it’s practical, easy to understand, and fun to build.
A travel planner combines simple data, user input, and filtering logic — which helped us practice Python basics while still creating something useful and interactive.
